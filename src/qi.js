 *     `assert`   : run tests against the subject, throwing if anything is wrong.
 *
 * Reverse phases:
 *     `teardown` : perform actions to undo `setup`, and reflect this in the model.
 *     `finally`  : run tests to check that the subject tore down correctly.
 *
 * All phases are optional, but it's recommended that you at least supply setup and teardown phase
 * functions.
 *
 * Phase functions are passed the model (an Map) and should return it with any changes. If
 * your phase function does not need to return any data you can wrap it in `utils.effect` from this
